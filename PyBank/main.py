#Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

import os
import csv

# Path to collect data from the Resources folder
budget_data_csv = os.path.join('..', 'Resources', 'budget_data.csv')

#The total number of months included in the dataset
def print_profitlosses(BankData):
    Date = int(BankData [0])
    ProfitLosses = int(BankData [1])
len(Date)

print ("Number of items in the list = ", len(Data))

#The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


#Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes


#The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


#The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
